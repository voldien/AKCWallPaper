Tonight, it was a picnic at night while watching the stars. Seeing a shooting star, Yua hurriedly wished for something exciting to happen… and the shooting star crashed near their school, although it doesn’t seem like it created a crater from afar. They were dumbfounded by what they’ve seen, just as another shooting star shot by. This time, Yua wished that it wouldn’t land in the town… and it crashed in front of them instead. In the cloud of dust, a white-haired bunny-eared girl jumped out and ran towards the town. They ran after her and were surprised when they saw the new form of their school.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nJapanese name: あまたらすリドルスター\r\nVNDB Link: http://vndb.org/v12992\r\n\r\n\r\n",
